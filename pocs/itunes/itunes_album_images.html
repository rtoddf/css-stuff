				<p>In previous examples, we saw that there was a json node that gave us a url for album artwork. But what if you wanted
					an image that was larger than 100px x 100px? You can use css and stretch the image to 100% of it's containing div, but
					that only works up to a certain size before the image starts to look like crap.</p>
				<p>We can simply use string replacement to get a larger size. Here's the url that is returned when we ask for <strong>artworkUrl100</strong>:</p>
				<pre>http:http://a1472.phobos.apple.com/us/r30/Music/v4/2e/b7/9c/2eb79c2b-d51d-8cd6-c85a-ad338a1662a4/Cover.100x100-75.jpg</pre>
				<p>The image size is at the end of the url:</p>
				<pre>100x100-75.jpg</pre>
				<p>I only know of three image sizes: 100x100, 225x225, and 600x600. There may be others, but these are the only three
					sizes I've ever needed. Just use a string replace to change the image size in the url.</p>
				<p>The javascript will construct a search string with that artist and track title, return the album collections based
					on the search parameters, and display the artist name, track title, as well as the three image sizes with the album
					collection name and year of release.</p>
				<p>Type in an artist's name and track title into the search boxes and click Search.</p>
